# DECO2: Direct Optimisation Model

Direct Optimisation Model is developed as a standalone extension for DECO2 software. 
Carbon trading model, having emission caps and prices as variables, is integrated into initial version of DECO2. 
Resulting fomulation is MINLP, and it leads to greater decarbonisation and reduced cost (when compared to emissions and costs from initial DECO2 version and Indirect
Optimisation Model formulation).
