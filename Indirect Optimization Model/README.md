# DECO2: Indirect Optimisation Model

Indirect Optimisation Model is developed as a standalone extension for DECO2 software. 
Carbon trading model, having emission caps as variables and emission rights prices as parameters, is integrated into initial version of DECO2. 
Resulting fomulation is MINLP (however, non-linearity iss far less when compared to Direct Optimisation Model formulation), and it leads to greater decarbonisation than initial version of DECO2 and more cost (especially when emission rights pricess are less).
